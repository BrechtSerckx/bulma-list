# bulma-list
A simple list component extension for [Bulma](https://bulma.io).

The list component is a simple vertical pattern for displaying data related to a single topic. Inspired by similair patterns in [Ant](https://ant.design/components/list), [Material](https://material.io/components/lists), and [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/list).

## Installation

Install bulma-list via your preferred package manager:

### NPM
```shell
npm install bulma-list
```

### Yarn
```shell
yarn add bulma-list
```

This puts both the compiled css and the raw sass into the `node_modules` folder.

Depending on your needs you can then import either `bulma-list.css` or `bulma-list.sass` into your project after Bulma itself.

## Demo & documentation
The documentation is built using a copy of Bulma's own Jekyll based system to keep as close as possible to the official style.
